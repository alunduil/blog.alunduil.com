# 0. Record architecture decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Architecturally significant choices (picking between non-trivial
alternatives, locking in a dependency, accepting a one-way door) need a
durable record. Commit messages cover *what* changed; PR bodies cover the
merge state. Neither preserves the rationale a future reader needs to
challenge or revisit the decision. `CLAUDE.md` files
hold rules-for-AI, not project decisions.

## Decision

Record architecturally significant decisions as Architecture
Decision Records under `docs/adr/`, named `NNNN-kebab-title.md` and
numbered sequentially from `0000`.

Pick the format per ADR. Default to Nygard (Title, Status, Context,
Decision, Consequences) for a single decision. Reach for MADR when the
record turns on a load-bearing comparison: three or more options weighed
across several drivers, where its drivers and per-option pros and cons
surface the trade-off better than Nygard prose.

New ADRs land with `Status: Accepted`—the PR review that merges them
sets the acceptance. Later transitions to `Superseded by NNNN` or
`Deprecated` happen by edit. `Proposed` covers the rare ADR published
as a discussion artefact ahead of any implementing PR.

Skip ADRs for tactical implementation choices, framework defaults, or
anything a commit message carries adequately. Sprawl makes the
collection worth less.

## Consequences

- Future readers can challenge a decision against the forces that were
  in play when it was made, instead of inferring intent from diffs.
- Adding an ADR is a small discipline cost on the proposer; reading the
  set is a small load on anyone touching an area with prior decisions.
- Deferred decisions (for example, "stay manual for now, revisit when X
  fires") have a place to record the trigger condition, so
  re-litigation starts from the recorded state rather than from scratch.
- Risk of sprawl if used for tactical choices. The warranted/not check
  in the `adr` skill is the gate.
